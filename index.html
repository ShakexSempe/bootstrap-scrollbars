                            <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>Components and options for laying out your Bootstrap project, including wrapping
                                containers, a powerful grid system, a flexible media object, and responsive utility
                                classes.</p>
                            <h4>Containers</h4>
                            <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our
                                default grid system. Choose from a responsive, fixed-width container (meaning its
                                max-width changes at each breakpoint) or fluid-width (meaning it’s 100% wide all the
                                time).
                                While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>

                            <h4>Responsive breakpoints</h4>
                            <p>
                                Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of media queries to
                                create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly
                                based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport
                                changes.
                                Bootstrap primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source
                                Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.</p>
                            <code>
                                // Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
                                // No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap

                            <h4>About Node.js</h4>
                            <p>Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is started through a blocking call like EventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.
                                HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.
                                Node.js being designed without threads doesn't mean you can't take advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our child_process.fork() API, and are designed to be easy to communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the cluster module, which allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing over your cores.</p>

            <h2>Mongoose.JS</h2>
            <h4>An elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js</h4>
            <h5>Defining your schema</h5>
            <p>Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the
                shape of the documents within that collection.</p>
            <code> import mongoose from 'mongoose';
                const { Schema } = mongoose;

                const blogSchema = new Schema({
                title: String, // String is shorthand for {type: String}
                author: String,
                body: String,
                comments: [{ body: String, date: Date }],
                date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
                hidden: Boolean,
                meta: {
                votes: Number,
                favs: Number
                }
                });</code>
                <p>Each key in our code blogSchema defines a property in our documents which will be cast to its associated
                SchemaType. For example, we've defined a property title which will be cast to the String SchemaType and
                property date which will be cast to a Date SchemaType.

                Notice above that if a property only requires a type, it can be specified using a shorthand notation
                (contrast the title property above with the date property).

                Keys may also be assigned nested objects containing further key/type definitions like the meta property
                above. This will happen whenever a key's value is a POJO that doesn't have a type property.

                In these cases, Mongoose only creates actual schema paths for leaves in the tree. (like meta.votes and
                meta.favs above), and the branches do not have actual paths. A side-effect of this is that meta above
                cannot have its own validation. If validation is needed up the tree, a path needs to be created up the
                tree.</p>

                            <h4>Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js</h4>
                            <h5>Web Applications</h5>
                            <p>Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.</p>
                            <h5>APIs</h5>
                            <p>With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.</p>
                            <h5>Performance</h5>
                            <p>Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.</p>
                            <h5>Basic Routing</h5>
                            <p>Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
                                Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.</p>
                            <h5>Route Paths</h5>
                            <p>Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

                                The characters ?, +, *, and () are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.
                                
                                If you need to use the dollar character ($) in a path string, enclose it escaped within ([ and ]). For example, the path string for requests at “/data/$book”, would be “/data/([\$])book”.</p>

                            <h2>React.JS</h2>
                            <h4>Introducing JSX</h4>
                            <p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic:
                                how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared
                                for display.

                                Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate
                                files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that
                                contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not
                                yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

                                React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when
                                working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful
                                error and warning messages.</p>
                            <h4>Components and Props</h4>
                            <p>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation
                                <br>
                                Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
                                Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.
